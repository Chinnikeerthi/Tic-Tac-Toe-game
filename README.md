# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
Tic Tac Toe game using Java
✨ This Java code implements a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, featuring a 3x3 grid board with dynamic updates, player classes for human players with unique marks (X and O), and methods for placing marks, checking wins, and validating moves.
✨ The game alternates turns between players, displaying the updated board after each move, and announces the winner when a player achieves three in a row, column, or diagonal. This demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, Java syntax, and game development logic, showcasing a functional and engaging game.
